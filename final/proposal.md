# Final Project Proposal

For my final project I want to create a little interactable old-timey radio that can change songs depending on the 'channel' selected on a little dial. I don't really have any direct inspiration for this, I just thought it would be kind of fun to make it and experiment with having media present in the sketch, which I haven't done before. I also want to see if I can make a filter of sorts within p5 to make any of the songs sound more old-timey.

## Possible Issues

I haven't worked with media before or much with rotating stuff, and I want to make a rotating dial of sorts, so getting everything in the right spots will probably be a challenge in and of itself. Coding to create visual things in general poses a good challenge for me.

## Timeline

I will get started this week on learning more about media in p5 and how to use it, as well as getting the basic framework for the visual radio in place and start figuring out the dial.
Next week I'll select my media and figure out how to get some kind of filter over them, either in p5 itself or just some quick editing on my part. I'll just keep getting everything put together beyond that.
