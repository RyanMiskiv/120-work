# Final Project Readme

I started by building the visual elements of what was originally a TV, but hit a big wall when it came to incorporating the rotating dial. I struggled a lot with incorporating this element. When I hit this wall, I tried to focus my efforts more on getting the video elements working, which I found to be a huge struggle as well. Getting the video imported wasn't too hard, and I was able to have it play, but formatting it to fit with the visual aesthetic of my project just didn't seem possible. I had a lot of trouble while working with this, so I decided to change my project into a radio that played music, which I thought would me a bit more manageable and largely the same overall.

At this time I was using the issue forum on Github to try and get help with my issue of getting the dial to work, which thanks to a very helpful individual, I was able to finally get that aspect working. From there it was smooth sailing to having each song play on its dial position. After getting that to work with the play() and pause() commands, I decided it would be more realistic if the songs kept playing even when they weren't selected, to emulate a radio station broadcasting live. I used the volume instead, which required me to change how I had the on/off button set up which was already messing with volume, and moved my code for playing the songs from the mousePressed function into the on/off volume functionality code in the draw() function. Overall I think it all ended up working and I'm pretty happy with the result. I thought about potentially adding more songs, but I decided it was good as it was. I would have liked to get video working, but it's whatever.
