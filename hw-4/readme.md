["Monster" Sketch](https://ryanmiskiv.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

# Homework 4 Response

We really got into it this week. Getting into a bunch of new elements of p5 and then going straight to using them all to build something. I created a 'monster' sketch of a murderous killer robot. To do this I made a grid on my piece of paper and sketched out what I wanted to draw. I then took that and used it as a guide for creating my p5 sketch, putting the values of my canvas onto my page, and keeping the sketch open on my second monitor and looking at the changes for every little thing.

It was laborious and difficult for sure. I faced a lot of issues in the top part of my drawing where there's a curved line, and because of this I wasn't able to draw it exactly how I wanted it to be, but there doesn't seem to be a solution, and by the time I did it I was out of time to seek help. My classmates didn't have any issues with which I felt equipped to assist.
