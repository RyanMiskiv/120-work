[Function Sketch](https://ryanmiskiv.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)

# Homework 10 Response

This week I refactored the code from original algorithmic sketch from week 5 to utilize functions and arrays. I really liked how that sketch came out and it was probably the one with the most moving parts out of all the ones that I've made so far. Refactoring the code into different functions was pretty easy. A lot like methods and stuff in Java and pretty straightforward, as my code was already pretty much sectioned within the draw() functioned by comments and everything was blocked together, and now it's even better! I struggled a bit with getting things into an array but I did it. Even though this could have been done without one it's there and it's utilized. When originally changing all the values, I ran into the issue of index numbers, as I forgot they start from 0. Which I should have known because it's exactly the same as Java but I had to go through and fix all that. Pretty simple week, just some shifting of code and some careful find-and-replace
