["Algorithmic" Sketch](https://ryanmiskiv.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

# Homework 5 Response

This week I created my algorithmic sketch. I tested a few ideas. One being a sketch that generated triangles at random locations across the canvas as well as random colors for each of them to make an interesting composite. I decided that wasn't complex enough and I drew from some of the examples posted this week for inspiration, and liked the circle one. I took that and experimented with it, and eventually started a theme of black and white and that contrast. I had some ideas on trying to move around the background elements to make what was on the surface look different, but I don't know if that's possible with the way p5 works. Like having different layers or something, so I'm curious if that's possible.

### Problems

I wanted to keep it bounded in the canvas, which I found difficult to find a working solution for. I went in during lab hours on Tuesday and had Emily help me figure out a solution to my problem, which we eventually did, using the constrain() function.
