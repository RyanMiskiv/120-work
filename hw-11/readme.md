# Homework 11 Response

This week I undertook probably the most difficult ambitious thing that I have done. It had a lot more moving parts and things than anything that I've built in the past and I must say I struggled a good bit with figuring out how to formulate all of this and get it to work as I envisioned it. I created little 'Caterpillar' guys that will run around the canvas.

The problem that I was presented with first was my object just not being able to be created and crashing the entire code, and to fix this I actually used the console in Chrome for once because I couldn't locate the issue myself, and found I just wasn't declaring the for loop variable correctly. The other logic part I had a hard time with was getting each segment to update individually and not have them be just long static lines, which I achieved through creating each circle as an object with all of its own data that is then accessed by a larger class which keeps it all together. I thought about going in for lab hours, but I was able to figure my problems out myself, although it took a lot of trial and error. I also struggled with getting the color randomization to work properly with passing the randomized data to the Caterpillar class, but I referenced some of this weeks examples to discover the color() function, which I didn't realize was a thing and I was trying (and failing) to use the rbg function and randomize each value individually as I did once as an experiment for week 6 that I didn't end up using.

Overall I'm pretty proud with the results of my work this week.
