# Homework 5 Response

  This week I learned about animation and the way the draw() loop works. I worked on a little Mike Wazowski guy, who most of his body followed the mouse, with a few parts staying static to make it just a little more disturbing. I worked with the new html preview panel to have everything update live so I could adjust it and then be able to see it very quickly. I had an incredibly difficult time with the rotating part. I just don't feel like I understand those concepts very well and have a hard time visualizing that. I tried to post about my issues with this, but I didn't get any responses (probably because it was at 8pm the night before it was due, but whatever). My classmates didn't have any issues that hadn't already been easily answered and fixed. There didn't seem to be much posted this week.
