["Hello World!" Sketch](https://ryanmiskiv.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

# Homework 3 Response

### Work

  This week I worked through some of the basics of setting up a p5 sketch.js file, as well as completed my "Hello World!" and worked with canvas and background elements. I followed the instructions and tutorial videos and then played around a bit on my own changing up elements to see what the result was.

  ### Issues

  I didn't run into many big issues this week, none that I couldn't solve myself. A few times I tried to refresh or open the index.html that I had been working with and found no changes, but that ended up being a problem of me clicking the wrong file in my project directory within Atom. I helped a classmate with a similar issue and shared my experience and fix for this problem.
