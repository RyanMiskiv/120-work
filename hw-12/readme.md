# Homework 12 Response

This week was a pretty big challenge for me because I initially tried to use my caterpillars from last week and have them bounce off of each other but I just couldn't figure out how to actually make that happen with the way that whole thing was setup, so I decided to go with something simple and easy for this project. I utilized multiple js files to have my code nice and clean and organized. For some reason the most basic functions sometimes just don't seem to work correctly for me, like I couldn't get the things to even move but then it just started working so I don't really know. But with what I ended up with I didn't run into too many large issues. I would have utilized some of my peers and resources but I started too late to really do that but it's ok because I fixed it all myself. Don't really know why they get stuck and I have no idea how to fix that.
