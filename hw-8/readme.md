# Homework 8 Response

This week I learned about and experimented with for loops and while loops. These things were pretty easy for me since they function exactly the same as they do in Java, which is a language I've worked in before. Applying this to drawing was definitely interesting and was kind of a strange thing to conceptualize. Applying code to drawing has been somewhat difficult for me to conceptualize overall, but I think I'm getting there. I didn't have many issues this week, since the project was so wide open and didn't really have any requirements other than involving for loops. I used this to practice applying for loops as well as using map variables and doing some math with variables, which is certainly helpful for me to practice.
